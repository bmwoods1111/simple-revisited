                      The jaguar is a compact and well-muscled animal. 
                      It is the largest cat native to the Americas and the third largest in the world, 
                      exceeded in size only by the tiger and the lion.  
                      It stands 68 to 75 cm (26.8 to 29.5 in) tall at the shoulders. 
                  </br>
                       It's size and weight vary considerably: weights are normally in the range of 56-96 kg (123-212 lb). 
                       Exceptionally big males have been recorded to weigh as much as 158 kg (348 lb).
                        The smallest females weigh about 36 kg (79 lb). It is sexually dimorphic, with females typically being 10-20% smaller than males. 
                        The length from the nose to the base of the tail varies from 1.12 to 1.85 m (3 ft 8 in to 6 ft 1 in). 
                        The tail is 45 to 75 cm (18 to 30 in) long and the shortest of any big cat.
                       It's muscular legs are shorter than the legs of other Panthera species with similar body weight.

                  The jaguar is mostly active at night and during twilight.
                   However, jaguars living in densely forested regions of the Amazon Rainforest 
                   and the Pantanal are largely active by day, 
                   whereas jaguars in the Atlantic Forest are primarily active by night.</br>
                    The activity pattern of the jaguar coincides with the activity of its main prey species. 
                    Jaguars are good swimmers and play and hunt in the water, possibly more than tigers. 
                    They have been recorded moving between islands and the shore. 
                  Jaguars are also good at climbing trees but do so less often than cougars.

                        <h3>Common Name: Jaguar</h3>
                        
                          <ul>
                            <li>Fossils of jaguars in Florida are much more common than those of other contemporaneous large felids, 
                                such as the American lion and the sabertooths Smilodon fatalis and Dinobastis serus.</li>
      
                            <li>The Pleistocene jaguars of North America were much larger than those living today in Central and South America, 
                                and for that reason are sometimes placed in the extinct subspecies Panthera onca augusta.</li>
      
                            <li>Jaguars evolved in the Old World and first dispersed to North America across
                                the Bering Land Bridge in the Pleistocene.</li>

          <h3>Overall Geographic Range</h3>
         <p>Historically, 
               the species ranged widely from the southwestern United States to 
              northern Argentina, but it is now extinct or nearly so in much of that area, 
              including the United States and most of Mexico.
               During the Pleistocene the jaguar ranged much further to the north and east,
              with records from Nebraska, Washington, and Maryland. 
              Its greatest known fossil concentrations are in Florida and eastern Tennessee. 
              The type locality is near Pernambuco, Brazil (Seymour, 1989).</p>
